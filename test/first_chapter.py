"""Judge the spec artifact's first chapter on CI: the median of RUNS runs alone against its second.

Reader: whoever reads or changes how CI checks that obs's spec artifact shows its first chapter
within a second (adapters/html/spec/artifact-ui.md), and CI's `first chapter` job
(.github/workflows/test.yml), which runs it outside the suite's shards.

The html adapter's test_startup_browser.py proves the order of the startup in every run and judges
its second only where it runs alone, but one runner's speed varies too much for one run to judge it.
So this runs that one test RUNS times, each alone in its own pytest process, from the adapter's
folder, with the test's MEDIAN_VARIABLE set: each run then judges only the order and records its
painted time and its budget as junit properties (PAINTED, BUDGET). The runs share one build of
the spec (test/spec_build.py, RUN_FOLDER). It prints every run's painted time and their median
(statistics.median: the middle time of an odd count), judges the median against the budget the
runs recorded (verdict: over it, not at it, misses), and names its own time. On GitHub Actions it
also writes one annotation titled TITLE.

While BLOCKING is false nothing it finds fails it: a missed median is a warning, and a run that
failed (the test's order or errors, which the suite's shards judge as well) or recorded no time is
an error annotation, and it exits 0. Once BLOCKING is true either fails it, and CI's `check`,
which needs its job, fails with it.
