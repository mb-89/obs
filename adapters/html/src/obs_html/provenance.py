"""The provenance check of a built artifact: built HTML in, findings out, each naming its place.

Reader: whoever changes what the provenance check looks for, how a build reacts to it, or its
exemption.

spec/architecture.md, Provenance check, owns the design. The module is pure: ``findings`` takes the
artifact's text and the local list's terms and returns what it found, and the CLI (cli.py,
``_write_artifact``) warns of each, or refuses the build where ``artifact.refuseProvenance`` is true.
A finding names its place (an HTML line, or a field path of the decoded data island, as the
exposure check names them: exposure.py, ``artifact_texts``) and the label of what it found, never the
matched text, as se's public check reports a hit.
